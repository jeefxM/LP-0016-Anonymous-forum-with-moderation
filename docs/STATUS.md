# STATUS — read this first to resume

Last updated: 2026-05-28. This is the authoritative "where are we, what's
next" snapshot. Static design lives in `SPEC.md` / `PLAN.md`; decisions in
`adr/`; this file is the live state.

## What this project is

LP-0016 submission: a forum-agnostic SDK + reference app for anonymous
posting, N-of-M threshold moderation, and K-strike membership revocation
on the Logos stack (LEZ + Waku). Bounty scope only — not a productionised
forum (see ADR-001, SPEC "Objective").

## TL;DR state

**The entire cryptographic protocol is complete and chain-verified.**
register → post → moderate → slash → revoke runs end-to-end on a live LEZ
chain. ~14–15 of 25 planned work-days in. Everything cryptographically
novel is done; the rest is packaging with no remaining crypto unknowns.

## Test tally (all green)

post_proof_core 12 · moderation-cert 8 · membership_registry_core 11 ·
slash-evidence 10 = **41 tests**. Plus Register + full Slash proven on a
live chain via `crates/lez-runner` (`forum_register`, `forum_slash`).

Bounty-named tests: 6 of 7 at logic layer (`valid_registration`,
`moderation_cert_construction`, `moderation_cert_verification`,
`strike_accumulation`, `slash_submission`,
`post_rejection_after_revocation`). The 7th, `valid_post_proof`, is
satisfied by `bench_post_proof` (real receipt verifies) but not yet a
named `#[test]` — see loose ends.

### P6.4 as built so far (Waku transport)

Decisions in **ADR-009** (symmetric-only encryption; ECIES deferred — no SDK
consumer; certs looked up by **nullifier**, not commitment; daemon stays
tree-stateless). Delivered:
- `sdk/src/transport.ts` — the only `@waku/*` importer. Node lifecycle
  (`createLightNode` + dial static nwaku), per-forum content topics
  (reg/post/cert), symmetric posts+certs / plaintext registrations, and pure
  helpers `selectCertsForNullifier` + `RegistrationSync` (leafIndex-ordered,
  gap-buffering, idempotent tree sync).
- SDK surface (additive to P6.1): `publishPost`, `subscribePosts`,
  `publishCertificate`, `listCertificatesByNullifier`,
  `subscribeRegistrations`; `register` now announces its leaf; the slash path
  is rekeyed to nullifier (`tryReconstructSlashEvidence(forum, nullifier)`
  → daemon `/v1/slash/recover` → fill Merkle path from `config.tree`).
- Daemon `/v1/slash/recover` (slash-evidence `recover_commitment`, rebuilt on
  Hetzner). `SdkConfig.transport?: WakuTransport`.
- **Dependency fix:** pinned `@multiformats/multiaddr@^12` via a pnpm
  override — `@waku/enr@0.0.33` needs the v12 `./convert` subpath that v13
  removed. Without it `@waku/sdk` won't even import. Clean reinstall applied.
- Verified: 20 vitest tests (incl. transport join/ordering) + `tsc` clean.
- **Live-verified** against a local nwaku (`sdk/tests/waku-integration.mjs`,
  run ON Hetzner — no tunnel): Filter delivery, Store `listCertificatesBy
  Nullifier` join, and ordered registration tree-sync all green.
  - nwaku run (cluster 2, autosharding 8, **websocket-support**, no RLN):
    `docker run -d --name nwaku -p127.0.0.1:60000:60000 -p127.0.0.1:8000:8000
    -p127.0.0.1:8645:8645 wakuorg/nwaku:latest --tcp-port=60000
    --websocket-support=true --websocket-port=8000 --rest=true
    --rest-address=0.0.0.0 --relay --lightpush --filter --store --cluster-id=2
    --num-shards-in-network=8 --shard=0..7 --nat=extip:127.0.0.1`
  - Gotchas (now handled in code): a Node light node has **no TCP transport**
    and its websockets default to **wss-only** — must dial a `/ws` multiaddr
    AND override libp2p with `webSockets({ filter: all })` (see
    `transport.ts`). Cluster 1 forces RLN (hangs without an eth RPC) — use a
    non-TWN cluster for local tests.

## Immediate next action (P6.4 finish, then P7)

P6.2 + P6.3 are done (see below). Build the Waku transport (`sdk/src`, pure
TS via js-waku): publish/subscribe post envelopes + moderation certificates,
and feed the SDK's `MerkleTree` (config.tree) from the commitments seen on
Waku so multi-member trees stay in sync (today the SDK only appends its own
registrations). This unblocks the three Waku-stubbed SDK functions
(`publishCertificate`, `listCertificatesForMember`, and therefore
`tryReconstructSlashEvidence`). Contract = `sdk/src/types.ts`.

### P6.3 as built (SDK client)

`sdk/src/` now implements the P6.1 surface for real:
- `tree.ts` — `MerkleTree` (depth 16, commitment-as-leaf, vendored sync
  SHA-256). Matches Rust `fold_path` exactly; the empty root equals the
  live-chain `empty_tree_root` (34fc..431d44) — asserted in tests.
- `client.ts` — `daemonPost` with daemon `{kind,message}` → typed
  `ForumError` mapping (+ `daemon_unreachable` on network failure).
- `index.ts` — all functions wired to the daemon. `register` /
  `createPostProof` derive Merkle paths from `config.tree` (ADR-004) and
  guard that `tree.root() === forum.treeRoot`. The 3 Waku-dependent
  functions throw `transport_error` pointing at P6.4.

Verification: 14 vitest unit tests (tree vectors + client error mapping);
`tsc -p tsconfig.json` clean; and `sdk/tests/integration.mjs` drives the
full register → post → verify → moderate flow through SDK imports against
the live daemon (SSH-tunnel localhost:8787 → Hetzner) — all green.

ESM note: relative imports in `sdk/src` use explicit `.js` extensions so the
emitted `dist/` runs under Node ESM (`"type": "module"`).

### P6.2 as built (proof-daemon)

`crates/proof-daemon` is an axum localhost server (default 127.0.0.1:8787),
excluded from the Mac workspace, built on Hetzner. ADR-004 governs it. It
holds no tree state; callers pass Merkle paths; it re-queries the PDA per
call. Endpoint → SDK-function map (all POST, JSON; 32/64-byte fields hex,
receipt base64, u128 as decimal string):

- pure crypto: `/v1/identity/create`, `/v1/moderation/sign`,
  `/v1/moderation/aggregate`
- chain: `/v1/forum/create`, `/v1/forum/load`, `/v1/member/register`,
  `/v1/member/is-revoked`, `/v1/slash/reconstruct`, `/v1/slash/submit`
- proving: `/v1/post/prove`, `/v1/post/verify`
- `/v1/health`

`publishCertificate` / `listCertificatesForMember` are deliberately NOT in
the daemon — they're Waku (P6.4). Chain helpers were extracted into
`crates/lez-runner/src/lib.rs` (the two runner bins are now thin wrappers).
Proving helpers are in `crates/proof-host/src/lib.rs`. Smoke script:
`crates/proof-daemon/smoke.sh` (needs `jq`).

Run on Hetzner:
```
NSSA_WALLET_HOME_DIR=~/lez/wallet/configs/debug \
MEMBERSHIP_REGISTRY_BIN=~/forum-protocol/programs/membership_registry/methods/guest/target/riscv32im-risc0-zkvm-elf/docker/membership_registry.bin \
POST_PROOF_BIN=~/forum-protocol/programs/post_proof/methods/guest/target/riscv32im-risc0-zkvm-elf/docker/post_proof.bin \
RISC0_DEV_MODE=1 ./target/debug/proof-daemon
```

## Loose ends / backlog (these were tracked as in-session tasks)

- **P6.2 follow-ups (new):**
  - **`verifyPostProof` cannot check revocation.** A post envelope is
    anonymous (nullifier + shares, no commitment), so the daemon's
    `/v1/post/verify` checks only: receipt valid + committed root == claimed
    root == current on-chain root. Revocation enforcement at post time
    needs root rotation or a non-membership proof — a real protocol
    decision for `docs/protocol.md` (P8). The SDK doc comment in
    `sdk/src/index.ts` still claims a revoked check; reconcile it in P8.
  - **`txHash` is `format!("{:?}")` of the sequencer's `HashType`** (in
    `lez-runner::submit`). Works as an opaque id; if a canonical hex hash is
    wanted, find HashType's Display/hex impl and use it.
  - **`createForum` polls `|_| true`** (returns first decodable state). On
    an already-initialised PDA it returns current state rather than erroring
    — acceptable for v1, revisit if create-idempotency matters.
  - **Daemon wallet unlock is boot-time env only** (NSSA_WALLET_HOME_DIR).
    An `/unlock` endpoint is a P6.5/P7 item (ADR-006).
  - **`jq` is now a smoke-test dependency** (installed on Hetzner). Note for
    CI / a fresh box. `smoke.sh` pipes bodies via stdin (`--data-binary @-`)
    because real-mode receipts (multi-MB) overflow a curl `-d` arg / ARG_MAX.
  - **`/v1/slash/submit` is verified at the library layer** (via the
    `forum_slash` runner bin) but its HTTP path (DTO→`to_wire`→submit→poll)
    was not exercised end-to-end in the smoke. Low risk (only the DTO
    conversion is new), but exercise it when P6.5 does the full SDK lifecycle.
  - **Verified:** 11 of 12 endpoints smoke-passed on the live chain in both
    `RISC0_DEV_MODE=1` and `=0`; real-mode prove (~55s) → verify round-trips
    a multi-MB receipt OK after raising axum's body limit to 16 MB.


- **#43 Pre-P9: trim post_proof to one RISC0 segment.** Real Shamir pushed
  it to 2 segments (524288 cycles, 54.87s on Hetzner CPU). Trim ~30k user
  cycles (fewer ark-bn254 modular reductions / reuse reduced secret Fr /
  TREE_DEPTH 16→12) to get back under 262144 = ~27s. See ADR-002 update.
- **#16 Pre-P9: re-bench post_proof on M-series Metal.** The decisive perf
  gate. Target <10s. risc0-zkvm `metal` feature. If (#43)+Metal still
  misses, escalate to Bonsai or off-RISC0 circuit (ADR-002 alternatives).
- **P5.5: add `valid_post_proof` as a named `#[test]`** wrapping the
  bench_post_proof prove+verify (mark `#[ignore]` for CI — ~30s).
- **#13 P8: locate the SPEL framework** for the membership-registry IDL
  (bounty Usability requirement). Not in the LEZ repo; it's a separate
  Logos-team artifact. Ask in their builder channel / find the repo.
- **#14: find LP-0001 (Private NFT) + LP-0003 (Private Allowlist) winning
  repos** for reference patterns. Nice-to-have.
- **Public LEZ testnet endpoint + faucet** — needed for P9's "two live
  instances." Not yet obtained; ask the Logos team.

### Docs & housekeeping loose ends

- **Unwritten ADRs.** `adr/README.md` indexes several decisions that are
  made-and-applied in code but not yet written up as ADR files:
  - ADR-004 (prover location = localhost daemon) — finalise during P6.2.
  - ADR-005 (re-implement Semaphore+RLN natively; SHA-256 leaf hashing for
    RISC0 perf, not Poseidon) — decision is live in the guests; write it up.
  - ADR-006 (moderator key storage = password-encrypted software key) —
    finalise during P7.
- **CI workflow is stale.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` was written in P0
  against empty crates. It has never run against the real crates and the
  guest builds (which need Hetzner + docker + ruint pin) aren't represented.
  Revisit before relying on CI; the bounty requires "CI green on default
  branch," so this needs real work in P8/P9.
- **`pnpm lint` uses `tsc`, not biome.** Biome 1.9.4/2.4.16 segfaults on
  this macOS (Darwin 25). Lint is `tsc -b --noEmit` for now. Revisit when
  biome ships a working Darwin-25 binary, or pick another formatter.
- **api-reference.md not generated.** The SDK's public API (sdk/src) has
  full TSDoc; P8 should generate docs/api-reference.md from it (bounty
  Usability requirement: "documented API").
- **docs/protocol.md not written** — the bounty REQUIRES it (unlinkability
  argument, anonymity-set analysis, retroactive-deanon-on-slash property,
  moderator trust model, threat model). This is a hard P8 deliverable, not
  optional. The material exists across ADR-002/003/008 + SPEC; needs
  assembling into the required doc.

## Environment (CRITICAL — don't rediscover this)

Everything chain/proof-related builds and runs on the **Hetzner box**
(`ssh hetzner`, x86_64 Ubuntu, 16 core / 30GB). The Mac can't
`cargo risczero build` (Apple-Silicon docker fails on the x86 guest-builder
image). Full recipe: **`docs/dev/local-sequencer.md`**. Key facts:

- LEZ checkout at `~/lez`, pinned rev `8c8f5b57` (matches `nssa_core` git
  dep, ADR-007). forum-protocol at `~/forum-protocol`.
- Live chain runs in tmux: session `bedrock` (docker, :8080) + session
  `seq` (`sequencer_service`, :3040, RISC0_DEV_MODE=1). Restart cmds in
  `deployments.md`. They may have stopped — check `ssh hetzner 'tmux ls'`.
- Wallet: `~/lez/wallet/configs/debug`, password `forum-protocol-dev`.
- **`ruint` must be pinned to 1.17.0 in each guest's OWN Cargo.lock**
  (`cd <guest dir> && cargo update -p ruint --precise 1.17.0`) — the risc0
  docker builder ships rustc 1.88, ruint 1.18 needs 1.90.
- Build guests in tmux at `-j4` (the keccak C++ kernels OOM'd the box and
  reset SSH at -j16). `libpython3.12-dev` installed for the wallet (pyo3).
- Deployed guest ImageIDs: membership_registry (slash-enabled)
  `6eca79ea50971688befcec8933459ce1776ae16e01906d7d6227c58fafd9e9c5`;
  post_proof (real Shamir) `3f2c559a601968be2033932ba798712b5e562f1bfe908cd33aba30369b78afc4`.
- Sync Mac→Hetzner: tar (exclude target/node_modules/.git/Cargo.lock) →
  scp → rsync into `~/forum-protocol`. Then re-pin ruint per guest.

## Conventions worth remembering

- **Commitment IS the Merkle leaf** (no extra leaf_hash). post_proof,
  membership_registry, and slash-evidence all agree — a bug here was
  caught by the slash-evidence round-trip test.
- **Two shamir copies**: `post_proof_core::shamir` (canonical) and
  `membership_registry_core::shamir` (vendored, because the guest docker
  context can't reach a cross-dir path dep). Cross-check test
  `slash-evidence::vendored_shamir_matches_original` guards drift — edit
  both together.
- Identity secrets must be canonical BN254 Fr (fits < ~254 bits) so
  `secret → Fr → bytes` round-trips for commitment matching.
